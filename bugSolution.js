The solution involves moving the asynchronous operation to `componentDidMount` to ensure the component's state is fully initialized before accessing it.  Using `setState` appropriately also helps in updating the UI after the asynchronous operation is complete.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchData();
  }

  fetchData() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.data === null) {
      return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    }
    return (
      <View>
        {/* ... render your component using this.state.data */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
By placing the asynchronous calls within `componentDidMount`, the component's state is guaranteed to be ready before any attempt is made to access it.  Also, handling the `null` state while data is being fetched enhances the user experience by displaying a loading indicator.
