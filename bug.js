This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has fully mounted.  This often happens when using asynchronous operations within the component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method, or trying to access state from within the constructor before `this.state` is properly initialized.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { data: null };
    this.fetchData(); // Trying to access this.state before it's ready
  }

  fetchData() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    console.log(this.state.data); // this.state.data might be null here!
    // ... more code
  }
}
```
